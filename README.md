The National Basketball Association, commonly known as the NBA, had a very interesting 2022-23 season. The fact that the Sacramento Kings made the postseason and the Miami Heat having one of the greatest playoff runs of all time is not something one had on their prediction before the season. But, there are still some questions about this season that should be addressed, even after it ended with the Denver Nuggets winning against the Heat. In this assignment, there will be an exploratory data analysis of the 2022-2023 regular season and how a player or team performed. The dataset that I am using is the "NBA Player Salaries (2022-23 Season)" dataset by Jamie Welsh on Kaggle [1].

While looking at the dataset, I did have a few questions written down that I wanted to address by doing the assignment. These are the following questions:

1. Considering the amount of money players are getting now, with a big story this offseason being that Jaylen Brown signed the richest contract in the history of the NBA [2], is there any positive correlation between a player's salary and their performance based on five specific advanced categories?
2. Which team was the most efficient in that season based on their shooting? Is there a correlation to how they performed overall(i.e. the Denver Nuggets had the most efficient shooting)?
3. Does position really matter when it comes to average salary and performance? This particular question is the most interesting one. 

All three questions will be analyzed to solve a bigger question: *What is the best scenario to potentially achieve the maximum amount of success if one gets drafted?* Many young children want to be in the NBA and become successful. By doing this specific question by analyzing the three other questions, I want to see if specific archetypes that provide the highest ceiling no longer exists in the game, so that everyone can have a good chance of doing that.
