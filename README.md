# Exploratory Data Analysis of the National Basketball Association (EDANBA)
I love basketball. I also love machine learning and data analysis. It kinda got me thinking about intersecting these 2 hobbies, so I did exactly that. In November 2023, I did an data analysis of the NBA during the 2022-2023 season, with the hopes of continuing this as a multiyear project.

As more years are added to the list, I want data scientists, teams and NBA fans to see both the evolution of the NBA and an evolution of my skills in data analysis and machine learning.

The 2022-23 EDA uses a stock dataset from Kaggle as I perform basic data analysis procedures with Pandas and Matplotlib.
The 2023-24 EDA is currently being made right now. This year, I'm going to be creating my own dataset with BeautifulSoup and using machine learning frameworks to solve more questions.
